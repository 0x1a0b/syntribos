=============
Configuration
=============

This is the basic structure of a syntribos configuration file.
All configuration files should have at least the section
``[syntribos]``. Depending upon what extensions you are using
and what you are testing, you can add other sections as well,
for example, if you are using the built-in identity extension
you would also need the ``[user]`` section. The sections
``[logging]`` and ``[remote]`` are optional.

::

    [syntribos]
    #
    # End point URLs and versions of the services to be tested.
    #
    endpoint=http://localhost:5000
    # Set payload and templates path
    templates=<location_of_templates_dir/file>
    payload_dir=<location_of_payload_dir>

    [user]
    #
    # User credentials and endpoint URL to get an AUTH_TOKEN
    # This section is only needed if you are using the identity extension.
    #
    endpoint=
    username=<yourusername>
    password=<yourpassword>

    [logging]
    log_dir=<location_to_save_debug_logs>


To test any project, just update the endpoint URL under
``[syntribos]`` to point to the API and also modify the user
credentials if needed. The endpoint URL in the ``[syntribos]``
section  is the one being tested by syntribos and the endpoint URL in
``[user]`` section is just used to get an AUTH_TOKEN.


Testing keystone API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sample config file is given in :file:`examples/configs/keystone.conf`.
Copy this file to a location of your choice (default file path for
configuration file is:  :file:`~/.syntribos/syntribos.conf`) and update the
necessary fields like user credentials, log, template directory etc.

    $ vi examples/configs/keystone.conf

    # As keystone is being tested in the example, enter your
    #
    # keystone auth endpoint url.

    # Set payload and templates path
    templates=<location_of_templates_dir/file>
    payload_dir=<location_of_payload_dir>

    #
    # User credentials
